Air Quality Prediction (Using Linear Regression)

Hello Everyone! Myself Yashank Rajvanshi, an enthusiast Data Analytics Engineer with an experience of more than 4 years in this field and having knowlegde of Python, PowerBI, DAX, VBA, Advanced Excel, Artificial 
Intelligence, Preprocessing Tools, Machine Learning. I am currently in my Final of year B.Tech Degree. My dicipline is Information Technology (IT). I have completed various projects and a 5 month internship experience 
as Data Analytics Intern at Kashsam Data Solutions.

Use dataset provided in the directory 

Here’s a detailed explanation of your code, organized into relevant sections:

1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
Loading Data: The dataset (city_day.csv) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
Head, Tail, Shape, Columns, Description, and Info: Initial exploratory functions are used to examine the first and last few rows (head(), tail()), the dataset’s shape (shape), column names (columns), and a summary of
the data (describe(), info()).
Missing Values Check: The code checks for missing values with isnull() and calculates the total missing values for each column using isnull().sum().

2. Handling Missing Data
Imputation of Missing Values: Missing values in the pollutants and AQI columns are replaced by the mean of the respective columns. This ensures that the dataset does not have any null values before analysis. For
example: PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, etc., are imputed using their respective means via fillna().

3. Missing Value Visualization
Heatmap of Missing Values: A heatmap is generated using Seaborn's heatmap() to visually inspect any remaining missing values. Since the dataset has been cleaned, the heatmap will likely show no missing values.

4. Scatter Plot and Line Plot
Scatter Plot of CO vs AQI: A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between carbon monoxide (CO) levels and AQI.
Line Plot of NO vs AQI: A line plot is generated to show how nitric oxide (NO) levels vary with AQI.

5. Data Preparation for Linear Regression
Feature Selection: The features for linear regression are selected using iloc[] for columns corresponding to pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO, etc.) and the target variable AQI is set to y.
Linear Regression Model: The LinearRegression() model from the sklearn.linear_model package is instantiated and fitted to the selected features (x) and target (y).

6. AQI Prediction
Prediction of AQI: The model is used to predict AQI based on specific pollutant values. The coefficients (a) and intercept (b) from the model are retrieved to calculate the predicted AQI (y_pred).

7. Visualizing Pollutant Distributions
Distribution of Pollutants and AQI: For each pollutant and the AQI, a histogram with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) is plotted using Seaborn’s histplot() function. This provides a visual representation of the
distribution of each variable in the dataset.

8. Correlation Matrix
Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix is computed for pollutants and AQI to check how these features are related. The heatmap of the correlation matrix is visualized using sns.heatmap() to observe positive or
negative correlations between different pollutants and AQI.

10. Time Series Analysis
AQI Over Time: The trend of AQI over time is visualized using a line plot (sns.lineplot()), where the x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents AQI values. This analysis helps identify patterns or
seasonal variations in air quality over time.

Each section of the code focuses on a critical aspect of data preparation, modeling, or analysis, and the explanations highlight the purpose of each operation within the overall context of air quality prediction 
using linear regression.
